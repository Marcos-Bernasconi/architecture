<h2>We design spaces and environments to foster social 
    sustainability and engagement in our neighbourhoods, 
    creating places for people to come together.
</h2>
<p>This is only possible when we seek and receive feedback from those who will use our architecture.
    Our fields of expertise also include the transformation of existing buildings, 
    as well as systemic and parametric design.

<p class="extra">Wood is our preferred material, and over time, we have built a wide-ranging network of highly skilled 
    collaborators in the field of timber construction.</p>

    <h2>Areas of Expertise
    </h2>
    <p>We design and build social meeting places 
        through the investigation into how communities develop and thrive, while adopting a process of cross fertilization 
        between the contributing actors of a design process.
    </p>
    <p>The transformation and recycling 
        of existing buildings and materials has become an intrinsic value and attitude throughout our practice, as a way to try and reduce energy consumption, 
        construction costs and the production of waste.</p>
